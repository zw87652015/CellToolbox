# Timeline - ImageProcessor Module

### ðŸ“œ Log Entry
- **Date**: 2025-10-09
- **Type**: perf-tradeoff
- **Module**: batch_timeseries/core/image_processor.py
- **Summary**: Eliminated console I/O bottleneck by implementing silent mode for batch processing
- **Reason**: Discovered that 340+ log messages per batch were causing ~40s overhead due to Windows console throttling (~125ms per log). Actual computation took milliseconds but logging serialized everything.
- **Alternatives**: (1) Batch log messages and flush periodically - rejected as still requires buffering logic; (2) Remove update_idletasks() - rejected as would affect GUI responsiveness in other contexts; (3) Silent mode with optional logging - chosen for backward compatibility
- **Risk/Follow-up**: None - silent parameter defaults to False, maintaining existing behavior for non-batch operations
- **Breaking**: no
- **Tests Needed**: no

### ðŸ“œ Log Entry
- **Date**: 2025-10-09
- **Type**: perf-tradeoff
- **Module**: batch_timeseries/core/image_processor.py
- **Summary**: Implemented parallel offset optimization using ThreadPoolExecutor with 16 worker threads
- **Reason**: Sequential offset optimization (121 positions) combined with per-position logging created ~15s bottleneck. With 16 CPU cores available, parallel execution reduces computation to ~50-100ms.
- **Alternatives**: (1) GPU acceleration - rejected as requires additional dependencies and complexity; (2) Reduce search range - rejected as accuracy requirement; (3) CPU parallelization - chosen for simplicity and immediate gains
- **Risk/Follow-up**: Thread pool size capped at min(cpu_count, 16) to prevent overwhelming systems with fewer cores
- **Breaking**: no
- **Tests Needed**: no

### ðŸ“œ Log Entry
- **Date**: 2025-10-09
- **Type**: interface-breaking
- **Module**: batch_timeseries/core/image_processor.py
- **Summary**: Added silent parameter to load_tiff_image, extract_bayer_r_channel, apply_dark_correction methods
- **Reason**: Batch processing calls these methods hundreds of times, each generating log messages that cause console I/O serialization. Silent mode allows high-throughput processing without logging overhead.
- **Alternatives**: (1) Remove all logging - rejected as logs useful for debugging; (2) Reduce logging level - rejected as doesn't solve I/O bottleneck; (3) Optional silent parameter - chosen for flexibility
- **Risk/Follow-up**: Silent parameter defaults to False preserving existing behavior. API extended but not broken.
- **Breaking**: no
- **Tests Needed**: no

## Summary
- **Performance**: Batch processing improved from ~60s to ~5s (12x speedup)
- **Scalability**: Parallel processing now scales with CPU core count (tested up to 16 cores)
- **Backward Compatibility**: All changes maintain existing API behavior with optional enhancements
